.<!-- I understand why you think I was rude, but you always give me a hard time when I can't / don't want to hang out. You know if the situation had been reversed I wouldn't have been angry. I see you during Break, Lunch, and even on days where I work I usually hang out for a couple of hours after school. That's the largest commitment I've ever made besides going to school and sometimes when we hang out I feel like it was a waste of time. Driving around / doing stuff after school for five hours all the time starts to add up. I've never hung out with anyone that much. I don't know how to explain it, but I just need some time to myself.-->.
.<!-- I also get bothered with your sadness a lot. You get sad and talk about how you're fat, no one likes you, you don't have any purposes in life, and other things when you know they're not true. I guess it probably comes from long talks with my dad about his problems that I can't fix, but I get so bored talking about things like that over and over. There wasn't anything I could do for my Dad to make him happy, and there's nothing I can do for you to make you happy besides trying to change the subject. -->.
.<!-- I care about your problems I just don't think it's possible to change your sad aspect on life. You're not fat. I've never heard anyone talk behind your back about you. You may not have a lot of hobbies, but you're certainly not trying to change that, and that's not what makes your life purposeful. Whatever, not like it matters... -->.
